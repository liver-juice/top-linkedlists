// step 1: breathe. step 2: think. what the fuck are we doing here. 
// we have to create the functionaliy to make a linked list.
// we have to make the functionality to make new nodes in that linked list.
// we need the methods/algorithms to actually search through that linked list and access our data nodes.
// this is a linear data structure. linked lists, doubly linked, circular linked.\
// linked lists do not require a contiguous block in memory. each node is just sprinkled randomly within our node sticks-
// because they can access eachother through pointers. 
// linked lists are an entry into more sophisticated data structures and traversals.
// a data structure is just an efficient way of storing data for a specific task.
// an object, array, variable, are all data structures.
// these structures sometimes hold millions of pieces of data, so efficient algorithms are necessary.
// we calculate an algorithms efficiency in time complexity, typically with Big O notation(most possible steps).
// something like a binary tree uses the divide and conquer technique, nodes can point to multiple nodes. O(log n);
// i assume a linked list is O(n), considering we must traverse the entire list starting at the head, calling the pointers to find our value.
